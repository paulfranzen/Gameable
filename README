A standard jQuery plugin.

It creates a simple canvas shooting game ala defender.

It allows the developer to configure some options to customize the game as they see fit.

<style type="text/css">
	#game_panel{
		width:500px;
		height:400px;
		margin:20px auto 0;
		border:3px solid #ccc;
		display:block;
	}
</style>
<div id="game_panel"></div>
<script>
	$('#game_panel').gameable({
		width: 500,
		height:400,
		players: [
					{
					"color": "#000000",
					"start_x":220,
					"start_y":370, 
					"lives": 3, 
					"image": "x-wing.png", 
					"width":32,
					"height":32
					}
				]
	});	
</script>

The game is based on the tutorial here:

But all the code is refactored pretty heavily.
